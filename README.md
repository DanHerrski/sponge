## P0 Steel Thread

The MVP is built around a single end-to-end steel thread: chat input → nugget extraction → scoring → dedup → graph write → next-best question → UI render. All planning docs are in `/docs`:

- [`mvp_spec.md`](./mvp_spec.md) — Full MVP specification (P0 scope)
- [`docs/risks.md`](./docs/risks.md) — Top 10 risks + kill/pivot criteria
- [`docs/technical-decisions.md`](./docs/technical-decisions.md) — P0 infrastructure decisions
- [`docs/steel-thread.md`](./docs/steel-thread.md) — Steel thread definition + API contracts + acceptance criteria
- [`docs/backlog.md`](./docs/backlog.md) — P0 backlog (10 epics, 47 tasks)
